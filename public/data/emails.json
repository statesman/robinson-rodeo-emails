Also, you and I briefly met at the Board meeting on October 31st.</p>\r\n<p>She mentioned she had talked to you on Wednesday night after I had discussed the Houston rodeo. BTW-the two of you are crazy to be leaning on a tiger in Thailand. Anyway, Claire mentioned the black tie Gala on 2/8 and that you had some tables. I'd like help with that.</p>\r\n<p>I was on a call with Gary Fuchs today and he mentioned he was planning to reach out to you on this topic as well.
