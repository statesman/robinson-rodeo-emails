# robinson-rodeo-emails
This is just a simple HTML graphic, using our regular Bootstrap starter, which uses images of emails to show conversations between former DIR executive director Karen Robinson and various tech executives. It uses [pure CSS speech bubbles](http://nicolasgallagher.com/pure-css-speech-bubbles/demo/) and images generated by DocumentCloud.

### Mobile & social considerations
- because the screenshots are static and the text within doesn't wrap, the screenshots are replaced by `<div>`s of the text on small screens
- the graphic uses our Bootstrap template, which is responsive
- the listicle format itself is an attempt to increase shareability by creating an easily-digestable version of the report
